Welcome to wagtail-tenants documentation!
=========================================

**wagtail-tenants** is an app for wagtail cms to provide multi-tenancy. 
My goal was to get a root wagtail instrance and use the beautiful wagtail admin
to host multiple wagtail instances without touching the server directly. 

It should be as easy as create a website within a running wagtail instance. 

I came up with different approaches and finally, after talking to a lot of others I decided to go the postgres schema path.
You can find a good documentation here and here.

Feel free to contribute to keep this alive. I am not the best at that ðŸ¤ž
